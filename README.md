SUMMARY: (feel free to change the wording in this to better fit our project as we move along)

Household/family organizer app, enabling organization of household tasks such as grocery list visible to every member, household budget management, meetings, kids' school events etc

One overall family plan, with individual users. The individual users can have their own subsections that only they can see, but the overall family has a centralized view that includes things like:
•	Calendar/Schedule
•	Grocery List
•	TODO list
•	Chore assignments
•	Household budget

User only views would be like:
•	Individual’s budget
•	Personal calendar, with the option of pushing events to the main calendar
•	Personal TODO list

Also have customizable options, like creating your own pages within it.
Users pick a color, that they can optionally change later, that will help distinguish their events in the calendar, the chores assignments, and maybe their contributions to the budget and grocery/todo lists.
